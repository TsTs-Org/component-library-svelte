[![Build](https://github.com/TsTs-Org/component-library-svelte/actions/workflows/release_package.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TsTs-Org/component-library-svelte/actions/workflows/release_package.yml)

# Use the library

Add this to your `~/.npmrc`:

```
@tsts-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=
```

where the auth token is a `Personal access tokens (classic)` generated by Github (only `read packages` scope).
This makes npm use the github package registry for every package from the `@tsts-org`.

Afterwards install the package via

```
npm install @tsts-org/component-library-svelte
```
